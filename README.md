# Deprecated Kalep Scanner
## Figma plugin
This plugin helps designers to scan Figma files and detect old Kalep components and styles. Old components often look the same, but have different architecture. The plugin will scan the current page, including all frames, and draw red outlined rectangles on top of old components or entities using old styles.
## How to use
1. Open a Figma file that you want to review
2. Find the plugin in the plugins menu (Top menu > Plugins > From Bolt > Deprecated Kalep Scanner)
3. In the plugin UI select "Highlight Old Kalep Components" or "Highlight Old Kalep Styles"
4. Wait until it is finished (you will see the summary as a snackbar with the total amount of detected entities)
Hint: all highlight rectangles will be stacked on the top of all layers and grouped
